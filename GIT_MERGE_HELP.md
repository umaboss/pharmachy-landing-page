## If Your Pull Request Won't Merge on GitHub

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Check if your repository has branch protection enabled
   - You may need approvals from other contributors
   - Some checks might be required to pass before merging

2. **Merge Conflicts**
   - If there are conflicts, GitHub will show them in the PR
   - Resolve conflicts by clicking "Resolve conflicts" on the PR page
   - Or merge main into your branch locally:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch
   git merge origin/main
   # Resolve conflicts
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

3. **Required Status Checks**
   - Some repositories require CI/CD checks to pass
   - Check the "Checks" tab in your PR
   - Wait for all checks to complete successfully

4. **Draft Pull Request**
   - If your PR is marked as "Draft", convert it to "Ready for review"
   - Click "Ready for review" button on the PR page

## Manual Merge (Command Line)

If you need to merge locally:

```bash
# Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# If merging a feature branch:
git merge feature-branch-name

# Push the merge
git push origin main
```

## Current Commits on Main Branch

- `d0d81b8` - deploy test
- `5ea03df` - feat: update features page with all feature images

All these commits are successfully pushed to GitHub.
